                <p>
                    C++ is a general purpose programming
                    language and widely used now a days '
                    for competitive programming. It has
                    imperative, object-oriented and generic
                    programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                    platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                    C++ is an efficient
                    and powerful language and finds wide use
                    in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                    real-time simulations. Because of the
                    inclusion of rich function libraries,
                    working in C++ becomes simpler and
                    convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                    programming like Java, C++ provides
                    the support of <span class="highlight">inheritance</span>, <span class="highlight">polymorphism</span>,
                    <span class="highlight">encapsulation</span>, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                    <span class="highlight">exception handling</span> and function overloading.
                </p>
                <p>The “<span class="highlight">Hello World</span>” program is the first
                    step towards learning any programming
                    language and also one of the simplest
                    programs you will learn. All you have
                    to do is display the message “<span class="highlight">Hello World</span>”
                    on the screen.
                    <br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>
                </p>
                <code>
                    #include<iostream> 
                    <br>
                    using namespace std; 
                    <br>
                    int main() 
                    <br>
                        { 
                            <br>
                            cout〈〈"<span class="highlight">Hello World</span>"; 
                            <br>
                            return 0; 
                            <br>
                        }

                <br>
                <p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
                    <br> The main pillars of Object Oriented
                    Programming are :

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">Object-oriented programming</span> – As the name suggests employs objects in coding.
                    Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like
                    encapsulation, <span class="highlight">abstraction</span>, polymorphism
                    etc in programming. The primary
                    objective of OOP is to intertwine the data
                    and the functions <span class="highlight">that</span>, operate on them
                    so that no other part of the code can
                    access this <span class="highlight">data</span>, except that function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Object : </b>An Object is an identifiable
                    entity with some <span class="highlight">unique</span> characteristics and behavior.
                    An Object is an instance of a Class. When a
                    class is defined, no <span class="highlight">space</span> is allocated but
                    when it is instantiated (i.e. an
                    object is created) <span class="highlight">memory</span> is allocated.
                    <br>
                    <b>Class : </b>The building block of C++ that
                    leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
                    It is a user-defined <span class="highlight">data</span> type, which holds its
                    own <span class="highlight">attributes</span> and member functions, which can
                    be accessed & used by creating an instance
                    of that class. A class is like a <span class="highlight">blueprint</span> for
                    an object. For Example: Consider the Class
                    of Cars. There may be many cars with different
                    names and brand but all of them will share
                    some common properties like all of them will
                    have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.
                    So here, Car is the class and wheels,
                    speed limits, mileage are their <span class="highlight">common</span> properties.

                <p>
                    The <span class="highlight">ability</span> of a <span class="highlight">class</span> to derive
                    properties and <span class="highlight">characteristics</span> from
                    another <span class="highlight">entity</span> is called Inheritance.
                    This is one of the most crucial
                    <span class="highlight">aspects</span> of Object Oriented Programming.
                    Subclass: The class that inherits
                    properties from another entity
                    is called Subclass or Derived <span class="highlight">subclass</span>.
                    Super Class: The class whose <span class="highlight">traits</span>
                    are inherited by sub class is called Base
                    <span class="highlight">class</span> or Super class. Using Inheritance, we
                    have to write the functions only one time
                    instead of three times as we
                    have inherited rest of the three <span class="highlight">classes</span>
                    from base class(Vehicle).
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>
            
                    <b>Public Mode : </b>If we derive a sub
                    <span class="highlight">subclass</span> from a public base class. Then the
                    public member of the base class will
                    become public in the derived subclass and
                    protected members of the base class
                    will become protected in derived <span class="highlight">subclass</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a
                    sub <span class="highlight">subclass</span> from a Protected base class.
                    Then both public member and protected
                    members of the base class will become
                    protected in derived subclass.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a
                    sub <span class="highlight">subclass</span> from a Private base class.
                    Then both public member and protected
                    members of the base class will become
                    Private in derived subclass.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Types of Inheritance in C++ : </b>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>Single Inheritance :</b> In single
                    inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit
                    from only one class. i.e. one sub <span class="highlight">subclass</span>
                    is inherited by one base class only.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple
                    inheritance is a feature of C++ where a
                    class can inherit from more than one
                    classes. i.e one sub <span class="highlight">subclass</span> is inherited
                    from more than one base classes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this
                    type of inheritance, a derived subclass is
                    created from another derived <span class="highlight">subclass</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hieratical Inheritance :</b> In this
                    type of inheritance, more than one sub
                    <span class="highlight">subclass</span> is inherited from a single base
                    class i.e. more than one derived subclass
                    is created from a single base class.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b>
                    Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by
                    combining more than one type of
                    inheritance.
                    For example: Combining Hierarchical
                    inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

                <p>
                    The word <span class="highlight">polymorphism</span> means having many
                    forms. In simple words, we can define
                    polymorphism as the ability of a message
                    to be displayed in more than one form.
                    A real-life example of <span class="highlight">polymorphism</span>, a
                    person at the same time can have
                    different characteristics.
                    Like a man at the same time is a father,
                    a husband, an employee. So the same
                    person posses different behavior in
                    different situations. This is called
                    <span class="highlight">polymorphism</span>. <span class="highlight">Polymorphism</span> is considered
                    as one of the important features of Object
                    Oriented Programming.
                    <br>
                    <b>In C++ <span class="highlight">polymorphism</span> is mainly
                        divided into two types:</b>
                    <br> 1. Compile time <span class="highlight">Polymorphism</span><br>
                    2. Runtime <span class="highlight">Polymorphism</span>
                </p>
            
                <p>Compile time <span class="highlight">polymorphism</span>: This type of
                    <span class="highlight">polymorphism</span> is achieved by function
                    overloading or operator overloading.
                    <br> Runtime <span class="highlight">polymorphism</span>: This type
                    of <span class="highlight">polymorphism</span> is achieved by

                    Data <span class="highlight">abstraction</span> is one of the most
                    essential and important feature of object
                    oriented programming in C++. <span class="highlight">Abstraction</span>
                    means displaying only essential information
                    and hiding the details. Data <span class="highlight">abstraction</span>
                    refers to providing only essential information
                    about the data to the outside world,
                    hiding the background details or implementation.
                    <br> Consider a real life example of a man driving
                    a car. The man only knows that pressing the
                    accelerators will increase the speed of car
                    or applying brakes will stop the car but he
                    does not know about how on pressing accelerator
                    the speed is actually increasing, he does
                    not know about the inner mechanism of the car
                    or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
                    etc in the car. This is what <span class="highlight">abstraction</span> is.

                    implement <span class="highlight">Abstraction</span> in C++ using classes.
                    Class helps us to group data members and member
                    functions using available access specifiers. A
                    Class can decide which data member will be
                    visible to outside
                    world and which is not.
                    <br>
                    <b><span class="highlight">Abstraction</span> in Header files:</b> One
                    more type of <span class="highlight">abstraction</span> in C++ can be
                    header files. For example, consider the
                    pow() method present in math.h header file.
                    Whenever we need to calculate power of a
                    number, we simply call the
                    function pow() present in the math.h header
                    file and pass the numbers as arguments
                    without knowing the underlying algorithm
                    according to which the function is actually
                    calculating power of numbers.

                    the data and the functions that manipulates them. Consider a real life example
                    of <span class="highlight">encapsulation</span>, in a company there are different
                    sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance
                    section handles all the financial transactions and keep records of all the data
                    related to finance. Similarly the sales section handles all the sales related
                    activities and keep records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                    when for some reason an official from finance section needs all the data about
                    sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access
                    the data of sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer
                    in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data. This is
                    what <span class="highlight">encapsulation</span> is. Here the data of sales section
                    and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”.

                    <span class="highlight">Encapsulation</span> also lead to data abstraction or hiding.
                    As using <span class="highlight">encapsulation</span> also hides the data. In the above example
                    the data of any of the section like sales, finance or accounts is hidden from any
                    other section.<br>
                    In C++ <span class="highlight">encapsulation</span> can be implemented using Class and
                    access modifiers.
